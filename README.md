## Overall Learning 

> _Gained hands-on experience with cloud computing and DevOps practices. Worked with AWS services such as EC2, ELB, EBS, and VPC to design and manage scalable infrastructure. Also learned containerization and automation using Docker and Jenkins, and orchestrated applications using Kubernetes, strengthening my understanding of building, deploying, and managing cloud-native applications._

</div>

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: E - Learning Platform</h3>
<p>
 Full Stack E - Learning application incorporating an easy to navigate UI experience bulit on top of MongoDB/Express Data layer and deployed on AWS EC2.  Served as the Project Supervisor streamlining the coordination and co-operation of the backend and frontend teams during the development process.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<!-- Project 2 -->
<h3 id="project2">Project 2: Library Mangement System</h3>
<p>
  This project is a containerized Library Management System deployed on a Minikube cluster, featuring a Node.js backend and a MongoDB database with Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) for reliable data storage. By using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration, the system ensures a self-healing, scalable environment for managing book requests and administrative approvals. This setup demonstrates a modern DevOps workflow, moving from local development to a cloud-native deployment.
